Our  Project sets the stage for using machine learning to better detect pneumothorax, a serious lung condition. By deeply understanding our dataset and the nature of pneumothorax, we're not just doing research; we're taking steps to use AI in real-world medical settings. Our goal is to help doctors quickly and accurately diagnose pneumothorax, ultimately making a real difference in patient care. We combine detailed data analysis with the development of a specialized AI model, showing how technology can be a powerful tool in healthcare
